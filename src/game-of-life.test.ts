/**
 * Rules
 * -------------------
 * a living cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies,
 * a living cell with 2 living neighbors survives,
 * a living cell with 3 living neighbors survives,
 * a living cell with more than 3 living neighbors dies,
 * a dead cell with 3 neighbors alive comes to life.
 *
 *
 * Test cases
 * ------------------
 * - any cell with fewer than 2 neighbors, regardless of whether it is currently alive or dead, will die after a tick,
 * - every cell with exactly 3 neighbors, regardless of whether it is currently alive or dead, will be alive after the "tick",
 * - if a cell currently has 2 neighbors, the cell will only be alive after tick if itâ€™s already alive.
